## 🚀 HOW TO RUN TESTS NOW

### **Method 1: Quick Run (Recommended)**

Open **PowerShell** and run:

```powershell
# Step 1: Navigate to Backend folder
cd "d:\Tugas\RPL\New folder\Backend"

# Step 2: Make sure services are running (open separate terminals)
# Terminal 1: redis-server
# Terminal 2: cd services/auth && npm run dev
# Terminal 3: cd services/booking && npm run dev

# Step 3: Run tests
npm test
```

### **Method 2: With Automated Checks**

```powershell
cd "d:\Tugas\RPL\New folder\Backend"
node scripts/test-runner.js
```

This will check prerequisites automatically!

## 📋 Prerequisites (Must Have Running)

Before running tests, ensure these are running:

### 1. Redis
```powershell
redis-server
```

### 2. Auth Service
```powershell
cd "d:\Tugas\RPL\New folder\Backend\services\auth"
npm run dev
# Wait for: "✅ Auth Service running on http://localhost:3001"
```

### 3. Booking Service
```powershell
cd "d:\Tugas\RPL\New folder\Backend\services\booking"
npm run dev
# Wait for: "✅ Booking Service running on http://localhost:3004"
```

**Quick Health Check:**
```powershell
curl http://localhost:3001/health  # Auth Service
curl http://localhost:3004/health  # Booking Service
redis-cli ping                      # Redis
```

## 🔍 Verification Steps

After setup, verify everything works:

### 1. Check Test Discovery
```powershell
npx jest --listTests
# Should show 3 test files
```

### 2. Run Dry Run (No Execution)
```powershell
npm test -- --listTests
```

### 3. Run Single Test File
```powershell
npm test -- services/auth/__tests__/authIntegration.test.ts
```

### 4. Run Full Suite
```powershell
npm test
```

### 5. Generate Coverage
```powershell
npm run test:coverage
# Open: coverage/index.html
```

## 📁 Key Configuration Files

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|--------|
| `.env.test` | Test environment (Remote Supabase) | ✅ Configured |
| `jest.config.js` | Jest configuration | ✅ Ready |
| `package.json` | Scripts defined | ✅ Ready |
| `tests/setup.ts` | Global test setup | ✅ Ready |

## 🌐 Testing Against Remote Supabase

**Important:** These tests run against **PRODUCTION** Supabase:
- URL: `https://xlrwvzwpecprhgzfcqxw.supabase.co`
- All test data uses unique identifiers (`test-{timestamp}@...`)
- Automatic cleanup after tests
- Safe for production environment

**Data Safety Features:**
✅ Unique test email patterns
✅ Automatic cleanup in `afterAll()` hooks
✅ Idempotency keys for booking tests
✅ Won't interfere with real user data

---

## 💡 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Cannot find module '@supabase/supabase-js'"
**Solution:** Install dependencies in service folders
```powershell
cd services/auth && npm install
cd services/booking && npm install
```

### Issue: "Connection refused ECONNREFUSED"
**Solution:** Start the services
```powershell
# Auth Service
cd services/auth && npm run dev

# Booking Service
cd services/booking && npm run dev
```

### Issue: "Redis connection failed"
**Solution:** Start Redis
```powershell
redis-server
```

### Issue: Tests are slow
**Solution:** Check internet connection (Remote Supabase requires internet)
