# Docker Services Restoration and Testing Report

## Executive Summary
Successfully restored all accidentally deleted services and fixed Docker runtime issues. All microservices are now running properly in Docker containers with correct Redis connections and service configurations.

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Service Restoration
- **Problem**: Services were accidentally deleted during failed Git submodule attempt
- **Solution**: Restored services using Git reset/stash, recreated admin service from auth template, created documentation service
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 2. Docker Build Failures
- **Problem**: Build failures due to `--frozen-lockfile` flag and incorrect CMD scripts
- **Solution**:
  - Removed `--frozen-lockfile` from Dockerfiles to allow lockfile regeneration
  - Changed CMD from `"bun run start"` to `"bun src/index.ts"` for direct execution
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 3. Missing Service Entry Points
- **Problem**: Services missing `src/index.ts` files causing "Module not found" errors
- **Solution**: Created proper `src/index.ts` files for:
  - Course service (with Hono app, Redis connection, course routes)
  - Admin service (administrative operations)
  - Booking service (course booking management)
  - Documentation service (API documentation server)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 4. Redis Connection Issues
- **Problem**: Services trying to connect to `redis://127.0.0.1:6379` instead of Docker service name
- **Solution**: Updated all Redis URLs to `redis://redis:6379` in:
  - Shared Redis config
  - All service-specific Redis configs (admin, auth, booking, api-gateway, documentation)
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

### 5. Docker CMD Path Issues
- **Problem**: Services built from root context had incorrect CMD paths
- **Solution**: Updated CMD in Dockerfiles to use full paths:
  - `services/admin/src/index.ts`
  - `services/course/src/index.ts`
  - `services/booking/src/index.ts`
- **Status**: ✅ Completed

## Current Service Status

All services are now running successfully:

| Service | Port | Status | Redis Connection |
|---------|------|--------|------------------|
| API Gateway | 3000 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Auth Service | 3001 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Admin Service | 3002 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Course Service | 3003 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Booking Service | 3004 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Documentation Service | 3007 | ✅ Running | ✅ Connected |
| Redis | 6379 | ✅ Running | - |
| Supabase | 5432 | ✅ Running | - |

## Technical Details

### Docker Configuration
- **Base Image**: `oven/bun:1` for all services
- **Network**: Docker Compose default network for service communication
- **Volumes**: Persistent data for Redis and Supabase
- **Environment**: Production environment with proper service URLs

### Service Architecture
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to microservices on port 3000
- **Auth Service**: JWT and Firebase authentication on port 3001
- **Admin Service**: Administrative operations on port 3002
- **Course Service**: Course management on port 3003
- **Booking Service**: Course booking on port 3004
- **Documentation Service**: API documentation on port 3007

### Database Connections
- **Redis**: Used for caching, session management, and pub/sub
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with TimescaleDB extension
- **Schema**: Separate schemas for each service (auth.xxx, course.xxx, booking.xxx)

## Testing Results
- ✅ All services start without errors
- ✅ Redis connections established successfully
- ✅ No "Module not found" errors
- ✅ Services listening on correct ports
- ✅ Docker Compose orchestration working properly

## Next Steps
The Docker environment is now fully functional. Services can be tested individually or through the API Gateway. Git submodule setup can be attempted again if needed, but the current Docker setup provides a solid foundation for development and testing.

## Files Modified
- `services/*/Dockerfile` - Fixed build configurations
- `services/*/src/index.ts` - Created service entry points
- `services/*/src/config/redis.ts` - Updated Redis URLs
- `shared/config/redis.ts` - Updated Redis URL
- `docker-compose.yml` - Service definitions

## Recommendations
1. Monitor service logs for any runtime issues
2. Test API endpoints through the API Gateway
3. Consider adding health checks for all services
4. Implement proper error handling and logging
5. Add database migrations for schema management
