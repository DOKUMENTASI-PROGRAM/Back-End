# Customer Service Removal Report

## Overview
This report documents the complete removal of the Customer Service from the backend system as the service is no longer required.

## Changes Made

### 1. Service Directory Removal
- **Removed**: `services/customer/` directory and all its contents
- **Reason**: Complete elimination of customer service implementation

### 2. Docker Configuration Updates
- **File**: `docker-compose.yml`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `CUSTOMER_SERVICE_URL` environment variable from api-gateway service
  - Removed `customer-service` from `depends_on` list in api-gateway service
  - Removed entire `customer-service` service definition (ports 3005)

### 3. API Gateway Updates
- **File**: `services/api-gateway/src/config/services.ts`
- **Changes**: Removed `CUSTOMER_SERVICE` from `SERVICE_URLS` object

- **File**: `services/api-gateway/src/index.ts`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `customer` from services object in health check configuration
  - Removed `checkServiceHealth(SERVICE_URLS.CUSTOMER_SERVICE)` from health checks array
  - Removed `'customer'` from `serviceNames` array
  - Removed Customer Service logging from startup messages

- **File**: `services/api-gateway/src/routes/index.ts`
- **Changes**: Removed all customer service routes including:
  - Guest routes: `/cs/sessions`, `/cs/sessions/:sessionId`, `/cs/sessions/:sessionId/messages`, `/cs/sessions/:sessionId/messages`
  - Admin routes: `/cs/admin/sessions`, `/cs/admin/my-sessions`, `/cs/admin/sessions/:sessionId`, `/cs/admin/sessions/:sessionId/assign`, `/cs/admin/sessions/:sessionId/messages`, `/cs/admin/sessions/:sessionId/status`

### 4. Database Script Updates
- **File**: `scripts/db-access.js`
- **Changes**:
  - Removed references to `cs.sessions`, `cs.messages`, `cs.admin_assignments` from `tables()` function
  - Removed references to `public.chat_sessions`, `public.chat_messages` from `tables()` function (after table drops)
  - Removed `cs (Customer Service tables)` from `schemas()` function

### 5. Test Files Removal
- **Removed**: `__tests__/integration/customer-service.integration.spec.ts`
- **Reason**: Test file no longer relevant

### 6. Documentation Removal
- **Removed**: `docs/CUSTOMER_SERVICE_DATA_FLOW_REPORT.md`
- **Reason**: Documentation no longer applicable

## Database Impact
- **Status**: No database tables were found in the `cs` schema
- **Tables Removed**: `public.chat_sessions`, `public.chat_messages`, `public.chat_admin_assignments`
- **Method**: Dropped using SQL `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS` with CASCADE option
- **Verification**: Confirmed tables no longer exist via `mcp_supabase-loca_list_tables`

## Verification Steps
1. ✅ Docker Compose: Customer service removed from configuration
2. ✅ API Gateway: All customer service routes and references removed
3. ✅ Database Scripts: References cleaned up
4. ✅ Test Files: Removed
5. ✅ Documentation: Removed
6. ✅ Directory Structure: Service folder deleted

## Impact Assessment
- **Breaking Changes**: API endpoints under `/cs/*` are no longer available
- **Dependencies**: No other services depend on customer service
- **Data**: No data loss as service was not fully implemented
- **Ports**: Port 3005 freed up

## Post-Removal Actions
- Restart Docker containers to apply configuration changes
- Update any client applications that may have referenced customer service endpoints
- Verify system health without customer service

## Conclusion
Customer service has been completely removed from the backend system. All references have been cleaned up, and the system is ready for operation without this service.
