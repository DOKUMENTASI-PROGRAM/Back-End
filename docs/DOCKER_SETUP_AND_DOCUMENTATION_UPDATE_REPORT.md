# Docker Setup and Documentation Update Report

**Date:** October 15, 2025  
**Updated By:** GitHub Copilot  
**Project:** Shema Music Backend  

## 📋 Overview

This report documents the completion of two major tasks in the Shema Music Backend project:
1. Update of HTML API documentation with latest endpoint information
2. Successful setup and running of Docker containers for all backend services

## 🔄 Tasks Completed

### 1. **HTML Documentation Update**
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**File Updated:** `services/documentation/public/index.html`

#### Changes Made:
- **Booking Service**: Updated course registration endpoint paths and enhanced request bodies
- **Auth Service**: Added Firebase authentication endpoints and updated architecture description
- **Admin Service**: Corrected endpoint paths for user management
- **Course Service**: Updated course-related endpoint paths
- **Customer Service**: Updated customer service endpoint paths

#### Key Improvements:
- Removed `/api/` prefix from all service endpoints to match current implementation
- Added comprehensive request/response examples
- Updated service descriptions to reflect current architecture
- Added missing endpoints for enrollment management

### 2. **Docker Container Setup**
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Configuration File:** `docker-compose.yml`

#### Services Started:
| Service | Port | Status | Health Check |
|---------|------|--------|--------------|
| API Gateway | 3000 | ✅ Running | Healthy |
| Auth Service | 3001 | ✅ Running | - |
| Admin Service | 3002 | ✅ Running | - |
| Course Service | 3003 | ✅ Running | - |
| Booking Service | 3004 | ✅ Running | - |
| Customer Service | 3005 | ✅ Running | - |
| Documentation Service | 3007 | ✅ Running | Starting |
| Redis | 6379 | ✅ Running | Healthy |
| Supabase (PostgreSQL) | 54330 | ✅ Running | Healthy |

#### Infrastructure Components:
- **Redis**: In-memory data store for caching and sessions
- **Supabase**: PostgreSQL database with authentication
- **API Gateway**: Entry point for all external API calls
- **Microservices**: Modular architecture with separate services for each domain

#### Issues Resolved:
- **Docker Desktop**: Initially not running - resolved by starting Docker Desktop
- **Port Conflict**: Port 3007 was in use by orphaned container - resolved by stopping conflicting container
- **Container Cleanup**: Removed orphaned containers to prevent conflicts

## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Environment Configuration
- **OS**: Windows 11
- **Docker Version**: Docker Desktop
- **Container Runtime**: Docker Engine
- **Orchestration**: Docker Compose

### Service Architecture
```
API Gateway (Port 3000)

- **Local Development**: Docker container with PostgreSQL
- **Migration Scripts**: Available in `scripts/` directory
- **Schema Structure**: Multi-schema (auth.*, course.*, booking.*, etc.)

## ✅ Validation Results

### Container Health Check
```
[+] Running 9/9
- All services successfully started
- Health checks passing for critical services (API Gateway, Redis, Supabase)
- Documentation service health check in progress
```

### API Documentation
- **Access URL**: http://localhost:3007
- **Content**: Updated with latest endpoint information
- **Coverage**: All services documented with examples

## 📈 Next Steps

1. **Environment Variables**: Verify `.env` files are properly configured
2. **API Testing**: Test all endpoints through API Gateway
3. **Database Initialization**: Run migration scripts if needed
4. **Development Workflow**: Begin feature development with running containers

## 🔍 Testing Credentials

For testing purposes:
- **User Account**: kiana@gmail.com / Kiana423
- **Admin Account**: admin@shemamusic.com / Admin123!

## 📝 Notes

- All containers are configured to restart automatically
- Code changes are hot-reloaded due to volume mounting
- Database changes should be made via Supabase remote access
- Documentation is served via dedicated documentation service
